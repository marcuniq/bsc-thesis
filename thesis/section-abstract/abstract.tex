The most popular algorithm for recommender systems utilizes the collaborative filtering technique which makes only use of the user-item rating matrix.
This thesis introduces two approaches which employ extra data encoded as feature vectors.
One of our proposed models, MPCFs-SI, is based on a nonlinear matrix factorization model for collaborative filtering (MPCFs) and utilizes the extra data to regularize the model.
The second model called MFNN is an ensemble of a matrix factorization and a neural network and uses the extra data as an input to the neural network.
Our results show that MPCFs-SI outperforms the baseline recommender MPCFs on a subset of both MovieLens 100k and MovieLens 1M datasets.
MFNN is inferior to the MPCFs model on our MovieLens 100k subset, however, it is at a similar performance level as MPCFs-SI on the bigger MovieLens 1M subset.
